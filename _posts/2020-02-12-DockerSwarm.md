Docker containers are simple to manage when you have one container or even [multiple containers on one host](https://mehlj.github.io/DockerCompose/). 

But what if you have tens of containers that you have to manage? What if you had to host these containers on several Docker hosts?

That is where [container orchestration](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-container-orchestration) tools come in. Docker Swarm is the orchestrator native to the Docker toolset.
