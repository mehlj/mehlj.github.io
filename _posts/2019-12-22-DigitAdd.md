## Implementation
This program's purpose is to accept an integer and then print a new integer by incrementing each of the digits by 1.

For example:
```
998 -> 10109
126 -> 237
```

This Python program:
* Accepts user input in the form of a standard integer
* Splits the input integer into a list[] of digits
* Increments each of the digits by 1 and places them into a new list[]
* Converts the new list[] to a single integer and returns that
