Docker is software designed to *containerize* applications. To wrap an application in a container is to package your application into a small, lightweight environment that can be run on any machine.

## What Problems Does Docker Solve?
### Works-on-my-Machine Syndrome
The *works on my machine syndrome* has always plagued the software development industry. Developers write and test their application in a specific corporate development/test network, or on their own personal machine. 
The users of the application, however, run the software on their own machine or environment.

This creates a major challenge in portability and troubleshooting, in that developers often have to troubleshoot application issues that occur on the user's machine/environment, but not in the developer's machine/environment.
The issue cannot be reproduced by the developer effectively - making the issue more difficult to solve.

Docker fixes this issue by providing a packaged environment along with the application. As long as they are using the same Docker image, the environment is identical. Issues can then be more easily reproduced.
