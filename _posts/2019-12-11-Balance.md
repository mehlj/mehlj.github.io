## Implementation
This program's purpose is to determine if a user-supplied string was **balanced** or not. 
Essentially, it should determine if the user-supplied string contained the same amount of `x` characters as it does `y` characters.
For example:
```
"xxxyyy" -> True
"xxxxyyy" -> False
```

This Python program:
* Accepts user input in the form of a standard string
* Loops through string and counts number of `x` and `y` characters
* Compares them
* Returns True if the counts are equal, False if they are not
